    "descripcion": "One of the most iconic FPS franchises from the 1990s saw an epic return in 2016 with the remake of the 1993 Doom. Developed by the original creators id Software and published by Bethesda Softworks, the first game of the rebooted series has surpassed the expectations of the gaming community and expanded the Doom fandom to new proportions. Buy Doom: Eternal key to experience an FPS game that is lightyears ahead and beyond of its predecessor! The scale, the stakes, the very structure of the game and the combat system – it’s all on a completely new level! Don’t miss out on your chance to once again become the Doom Slayer – a fierce warrior feared by the forces of Hell!\n\nForces of Hell invade planet Earth!\n\nVarious past installments in the Doom franchise – including the 2016 reboot – took place on an isolated Martian colony overrun by demonic forces. Buy Doom: Eternal key and get ready for more than 22 hour-long single-player campaign set on war-torn, post-apocalyptic Earth! Demons have somehow found a way to attack our planet and only the legendary Night Sentinel from the previous game stands in their way. Doom: Eternal will drastically elaborate upon the fictional universe of the series, exploring the millennia-long war between heavenly and demonic forces. Don’t miss out on new expansions to the epic Dark Siders-style Doom lore which is also loosely based on Judeo-Christian mythology.\n\nFortress of Doom\n\nIn between missions on Earth, Doom Slayer will spend time on his personal base of operations called the Fortress of Doom. Essentially, it’s a space station orbiting and overwatching the devasted human homeworld. Buy Doom: Eternal key and explore the new transit hub! Here you will be able to upgrade your weapons, try out different armor, discover in-game secrets and find all the collectibles you’ve uncovered during the single-player campaign.\n\nElaborated combat system\n\nDoom: Eternal is more than just a typical run n’ gun FPS game. It will have a layer of strategy: the specific ways you choose to kill demons will determine what supplies they will drop after dying. Shoulder mounted flamethrower will get you armor, chainsaw kills will provide you with ammunition while the glory kills from the 2016 game will reward you with health. Once you’ll buy Doom: Eternal key you’ll get a fully-fledged combat puzzle, where every kill is equivalent to a move on a chessboard. In a high-difficulty fast-paced action game like this one, small decisions made in split second are the ultimate factor of success in battle. Experiment with different weapon mods, make armor upgrades and find your personal, most effective way to “rip and tear”!",

Get ready to spend some time running around in an open-world city swarming with zombies, as humanity has plunged into a new dark age after the outbreak of a zombie infection. Try your hardest to survive in this post-apocalyptic reality among the hostile humans and the even deadlier infected.\nParkour system\nOne of the most notable features of Dying Light is its parkour mechanic that makes the game comparable to an open-world Mirrors Edge filled with zombies. You’ll constantly find yourself maneuvering in a zombie-infested city and being chased by the infected. Once you buy the Dying Light Steam key, you’ll get to explore a city both on horizontal and vertical planes as you try to survive among the walking dead and hostile scavengers alike, running and jumping on rooftops or hanging on to ledges until it finally becomes a thing of second nature.\nDynamic day and night cycle\nThe exploration of the open-world city is necessary to progress the campaign's storyline, accomplishing side quests or gathering resources for crafting. The world of Dying Light has a dynamic day and night cycle that respectively determines two completely different experiences of gameplay. During the day, you can explore the world and engage in combat fairly easily as long as you keep your guard up, but you should buy the Dying Light Steam key to experience the real sense of tension at night! Enemies become overwhelming and aggressive, leaving you forced to rely on stealth.\nMultiplayer\nWhile Dying Light offers an engaging single-player campaign experience that will provide you with many hours of gameplay as you’ll find more and more creative ways to combat the infected, the game also presents an interesting multiplayer mode. You can be accompanied by up to 3 friends in the co-op mode as you explore the post-apocalyptic open-world city together, using your parkour skills and running on rooftops to avoid the infected. However, you should buy a Dying Light Steam key to be the boogeyman yourself too! Hunt the living as a zombie by using flesh zip lines and spit that summons the infected. So use this chance to get the Dying Light key and experience the most definitive open-world zombie game title as of yet!",
